And if the inhabitants of tomorrow sent us letters?

From 2054 to 2084, from Iceland to Afghanistan, from cataclysms to utopias, five stories draw our possible futures during the "Mokatori", the word for climate change among Amazonian Indians  
**Ep. 0 - "The End" - Mexico City, Mexico, November 27, 2015**   
Ep. 1 - "Business as Usual" - Reykjavik, Iceland, March 20, 2054   
Ep. 2 - "Time Machine" - Taipei, 臺北市, Taiwan, November 13, 2084  
Ep. 3 - "In the Shade of Fig Trees" - Farsala, Φάρσαλα, Greece, July 17, 2077   
Ep. 4 - "Masters of the Stratosphere" - Walvis Bay, Namibia, February 29, 2060  
Ep. 5 - "Living" - Kunduz, کندز, Afghanistan, April 3, 2072   

**"The End"**, it's the end of one world, one before the Internet and before the IPCC reports, but until now it doesn't tell us "goodbye".
