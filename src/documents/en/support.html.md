This site and all its illustrations are available at a Pay What You Want price: As [Ploum](http://ploum.net/) say (which I am inspired for this page), it's not free of charge but you can choose the price.
You are free to support me or simply appreciate the scenery, **you can always download and copy the wallpapers that I offer freely**: this is what guarantees [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.fr/) licenses.

##<a name="why"></a>Why free?

1. Because drawing isn't so easy and takes a lot of time and material! Even gnomes need to eat.

2. Because I want to try alternative forms of compensation for artists. As long as you don't try, you don't know ;)

3. Because I wish to live from my art, and wish to dedicate myself to creation rather than fooding.

4. Because I'll be able to support other designers, artists and projects that I like with this money.
