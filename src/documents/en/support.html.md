# F.A.Q.
- **What is the difference between signing up to the Newsletter and behind the scenes posts in the Tipeee News ?**   

I'll post the same things in the newsletters and in the Tipeee news open to all, but the sketch, scenario and unfulfilled things we can still change will only be published in the news reserved to tippers.

- **I prefer to support you with US dollars, is it possible ?**

Yes, I've created [a Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/nylnook) and [a Flattr account](https://flattr.com/@nylnook) if you prefer, even if the main one will be the [Tipeee](https://www.tipeee.com/nylnook/) one.

- **I prefer to support you with micro-donations without rewards, is it possible ?**

Yes, I've created [a Liberapay profil](https://liberapay.com/nylnook/) if you prefer, even if the main one will be the [Tipeee](https://www.tipeee.com/nylnook/) one.
