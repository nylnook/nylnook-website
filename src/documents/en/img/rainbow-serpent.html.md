Illustration of the [Rainbow Serpent](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_arc-en-ciel), a creator god, with [Mimis (sort of fairies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimi_(folklore)) during [Dreamtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime) in [Australian Aboriginal mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_mythology).

I created this illustration for the activity book cover of the first board game I illustrated, [The Aboriginal Painting](../blog/aboriginal-painting-illustrations-board-game), by [Alice & Gédéon](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr/) (only in French, I'm afraid).
