A portrait of [Rocambole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocambole_%28character%29), character of the novel with the same name by [Ponson du Terrail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Alexis_Ponson_du_Terrail). It's from it's name that comes the adjective "rocambolesque" in french, meaning something is both fantastic and incredible in a novel or fiction.  
I tried to transmit the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality: judge, but assassin ...  
Drawn for a project of a trail game for my township.
