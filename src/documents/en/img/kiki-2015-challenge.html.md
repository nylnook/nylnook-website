Kiki The Cyber Squirrel, [Krita](https://krita.org/)'s mascot, at full speed !

My participation to the [special challenge](https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=277&t=125203) in the [Krita](https://krita.org/)'s forum to create a visual for the [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/krita/krita-free-paint-app-lets-make-it-faster-than-phot)'s reward T-shirt for Krita crowdfunding 2015.

From the original artwork by [Tyson Tan](http://tysontan.deviantart.com/), the Kiki creator !
Also an opportunity for me to test his digital drawing workflow ;)
