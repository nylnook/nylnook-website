[Svalbard Global Seed Vault](https://www.croptrust.org/our-work/svalbard-global-seed-vault/), opened since 2008, store at -18 °C (−0.4 °F) about 2,000 global seed varieties for hundreds of years.

[Navdanya Agrobiodiversity Conservation and Ecological Farm](http://www.navdanya.org) in India, safeguards, produce and share approximately 1500 varieties of regional seeds, and helped hundreds of similar projects to be born worldwide since the beginning of its activities in 1995.
