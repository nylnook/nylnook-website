A portrait of [Dominique Chaix](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Chaix) with an herbarium, a famous botanist in French Alps, and some of the most iconic species he contributed to discover (*Artemisia insipida*, *Verbascum chaixii*, *Plantago argentea*, *Galium saxosum*, *Lactuca quercina subsp. chaixii*, *Berardia subacaulis*, *Carduus aurosicus*, *Dianthus scaber*).  
Note that this portrait is a work of imagination, since there is no historical remains of a picture with his face.  
Drawn for a project of a trail game for my township. Personal education in the process : botanical illustration takes long time!  
Special thanks to [Tela Botanica](http://www.tela-botanica.org/) for documentation !
