D12 in Paris, Saturday, December 12, 2015: the demonstration of the activists for climate justice [at the end of the COP21](/en/blog/let-invent-other-stories-about-climate-cop21-placetob#d12) in which I took part, from photos of [Adriana Karpinska](http://karpinska.blog.sme.sk/) and yours truly.

Theses angels are called [Climate Guardians](http://climacts.org.au/climate-guardians/).
