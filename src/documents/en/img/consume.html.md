Consumption is climate change !
And Apple is not the last one to call to consumption... !

This is the first result of the first workshop, *Dismantling the buying Imperative* at the [Creative Factory](http://www.placetob.org/on-site/the-creative-factory/) at [PlaceToB](http://www.placetob.org) during COP21.

My thanks to [Chris Aldhous](http://foreverswarm.org/) for the inspiration ;)

This drawing was featured on the ["Cartoonists against climate change"](http://cartoonscop21.tumblr.com/) blog by the french magazine [Causette](https://www.causette.fr/) in partenership with PlaceToB
