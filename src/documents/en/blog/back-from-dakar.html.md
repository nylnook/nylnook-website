Since a week, I returned from Dakar where I was invited by the International Organization of [la Francophonie](http://www.francophonie.org/Welcome-to-the-International.html) to conduct training on **Blender and video post-production** during 5 days (from October 27 to 31) for 10 Senegalese audiovisual trainers ([see  the official announcement](http://www.francophonie.org/Senegal-et-Maroc-creation-d.html)).

We have spoken about [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), its video editor, its node editor for calibration, overlay and matte painting, video tracking, the [Tears of Steel](http://mango.blender.org/) short film and many other things ...

It was a very intense experience for me, in a country, a continent and a culture that I discovering, not to mention that it was also the first time I trained trainers and not "beginners".

I had three additional days to visit a little the town and its islands (Gorée, Ngor) and meet the locals (in the broad sense) at [Kër Thiossane](http://ker-thiossane.org/), a home for multimedia, arts and culture ... with his [Fablab](http://ker-thiossane.org/spip.php?article137) at two blocks.  
They even invited me to a small workshop on Blender and modelling this time. ;)

There would be a lot to tell, but in summary it is always ideal to get to know a country with its inhabitants, and the Senegalese are really welcoming.

A special thank you to Christian Ambaud, Marion Louisgrand Sylla and Modou Ngom. Hope to see you next time!
