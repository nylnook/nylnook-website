[As I mentioned before](/en/blog/conference-lsm-responsives-images), in Jully I gave a conference at [Libre Software Meeting](https://2014.rmll.info/?lang=en) in Montpellier, France.

It's in french, and I'm hestating at the begining of the speach, but you can view the video [here](http://video.rmll.info/videos/image-responsives-nouveaux-traitements-dimages-par-noeuds-et-graphs/) if you are interested.
