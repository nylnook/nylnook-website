[D-BookeR Editions](http://www.d-booker.fr/), more specifically Patricia Moncorg√©, interviewed me on my work !

It's in french, but you are welcome to [read the automaticaly translated interview if you're intersted](http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.d-booker.fr%2Fcontent%2F62-exercer-le-metier-de-graphiste-avec-des-logiciels-libres).

As a *pitch*, the questions :

*You work under Linux with free software: is what it has always been the case? What motivated you to enter Libre?*

*Does it feel sometimes a problem? Under what circumstances?*

*How's it going with your customers? What formats do you deliver them your illustrations? They know that you work with free software?*

*Could you tell us what software you use most often and for what purpose?*

*Many designers are reluctant to work with free software because they fear losing features, more complexity. What would you say to them? Should you be a little geek to use it?*

*What other free software do you use currently? How do you make your bills, for example?*

*Do you contribute in one form or another in one of the software that you use?*
