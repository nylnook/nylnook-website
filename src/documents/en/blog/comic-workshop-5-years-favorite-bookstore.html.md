[![Comic Strip to complete](/img/blog/strips-a-completer-thumb.png)](/img/blog/strips-a-completer.png)

This Saturday, June 18, from 10am to 6pm,  I will host a free **comic workshop** to celebrate the 5 years of my favorite bookstore, ["Au coin des Mots passants"](https://www.facebook.com/Librairie-Papeterie-Au-coin-des-mots-passants-146604752076713/), in Gap at place Gavotte.
I will propose you to discover the work of creating comics, littles exercises like filling thoses 3 frames strips, or begin your own comic book, or just to talk… and of course I will have some printed copies [of my frogs comic](../comics/climate-frogs) !

In the day's agenda: meetings with authors (Liliana Lazar, Guian Jian, Xavier Fournier, Philippe Gauthier), associations, refreshments, speeches, comic worshop… and presentation of the "Mots Passants Loving Dictionary" specailly crafted for this day!

Everyone is welcome !
