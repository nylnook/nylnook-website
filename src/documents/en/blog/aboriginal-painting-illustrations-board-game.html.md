During this year 2016, one of my biggest occupation was illustrating and doing layout for the first board game by [Alice & Gédéon](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr) and its author Séverine Fourel, in her new product line "Art course", I named… "**The Aboriginal Painting**" !

It was the first time I illustrated a board game, and I'm telling you today because finally everything is ready, after months of work, the game is published ! But I'm afraid the game is only in French…

## All right, but what is this game?

It's an educational game aimed at children aged 8 to 12 who want to explore their creativity and in particular to paint in the way of Australian aborigines.

The box contain 4 boxes full of stuff, for children, but also for parents which accompanies :
 - an activity book which will guide the child in several challenges
 - paintbrushes, paints and ochres
 - sketchbook and sheets
 - a box which transform into a painting studio
 - a photo lab to take pictures of his/her artworks
 - access to an online space to make his/her museum and share if he/she want with friends
 - guides brochures for parents
 - and a card game to choose in family what artworks will be entitled to an exhibition in a renowned museum ;)

## And you, what have you done?

The game was conceived and written by Séverine Fourel, boxes conception and design is by Philippe Perez of [Meta6](http://www.meta6.fr/), and I shaped their ideas with layout and illustrations for all the documents, the covers and the boxes, passing by playing cards:

We also designed a graphic chart and logo for the [Alice & Gédéon](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr) brand, as well as a mascot: a small ampersand character (&) named "Adéon":

And I also assumed the artistic direction of [Alice & Gédéon's website](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr), created by [Xslato](http://www.xsalto.com/), also making mock-ups, icons, avatars…

## Hmm, not bad, and if I want to make a Christmas present?

The game receives first orders on [this presentation page](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr/la-gamme-parcours-d-art.html) for 54 € (relatively to playing time and equipment, it's cheap;)).

Otherwise, you can be inspired by [drawings of young creators](http://www.aliceetgedeon.fr/tous-les-dessins.html), and jump to your sketchbooks to make aboriginal painting!
